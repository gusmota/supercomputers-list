# A very simple web parser

Hello world, this is my first repo. It basically contains two jupyter notebooks where I go and parse in two different ways a website to obtain information about the top 500 supercomputers. 
The result must yield a pandas dataframe

## Errors and completeness
Since this is a very educational excercise, the project has been left incomplete and ready for further improvement. This is totally intentional, in order to generate tons of pushs more

## The project in the future
The expected horizon for this project is to migrate from a simple notebook to a formal python script and later a module. Also to provide a reliable dataset for other projects
